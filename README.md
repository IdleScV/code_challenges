# My Code Challenge Library

This is where I store my finished code challenges. 
As of now, all code challenges are written in JS. 

## Purpose

Because I've done a good amount of challenges across the web (leetcode, edabit, codecademy),
I started this repository to organize all of that effort.
I like to organize.

### Outline

Each challenge begins with a commented description of the problem.
It includes an example of goal inputs and outputs.
Then comes my solution.
Lastly I have a console.log for the script to be ran in the terminal with node. 

### Organization(as of Jan, 25, 2020):

Finishd challenges are stored in the 'Completed' folder.

Code is further seperated by the type of type of input

    * Arrays
    * Objects
    * Binary Tree
    * Linked List

Work in progress code is put into the 'WIP' folder. That's it for now.

#### Also... 

* If a challenge requires more than one file, all files will be put into a folder.

* Otherwise, there will just be a named js file.
